This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error. The code attempts to iterate over an array using a for loop. However, the loop's condition is incorrect, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate over an array and avoid this type of error.
